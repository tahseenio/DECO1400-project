- The [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library created by michalsnik was used to create scroll animations

## Lessons Learned
- revised Vanilla JS knowledge and how to targeting element using querySelector.
- It was interesting to learn how a slideshow was creating using vanilla JS as I did initially have trouble figuring out how to determine what picture I was on how I would update the pills at the bottom.


## Future optimizations
- A better layout could be made for displaying the food trucks image and description
- Contact form is sometimes buggy and submits empty strings even when the user has inputted something.
